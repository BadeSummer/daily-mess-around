- [A short introduction to the Lindblad master equation](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5115323)
  - I thought it was a really nice intro for *general* `master equation`. The author mention a lots of book about quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
  - I just start to look through it and hope to finish it within one/two day!

### WORKS
**Relative**

- On these day absent for the log. I Finished the follows:
  - Define a `python` function to obtain Hamiltonian of hot model.
  - Plot the spectrum of JCM both in $\Omega = 5g$ and $0<\frac{\Omega}{g}<10$!!(no that much easy)

**Interesting**
- Ready to hang my servers to a public server so that I can login by any net environment.

- [A short introduction to the Lindblad master equation](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5115323)
  - 最重要的收获是：Lindblad超算符的出现是为了把量子刘维尔方程变成矩阵表示。核心操作是把密度矩阵的所有矩阵元“*拉直*”成一个向量。这样刘维尔方程就能表示称算符作用在“*密度向量*”上。

- Lecture of ASP by Yu Hongyi.
  - 考虑系统+大环境这个整体的`封闭系统演化`，然后根据 *Markov* 假设把外部环境 Trace 掉，得到一个密度矩阵演化方程：`Lindblad master equation`。


**Interesting**
- Different between VPC VPS.


**Others**
