### WORKS
**Relative**

- Find out what cause the "discontinue bug" of Eigenvalues, but i don't know how to solve it.
- Starting to organize the idea of JCM and relevents.

**Interesting**
- autossh bug that "TCPKeeplive" needs to be turn on.
### READING
**Relative**
- [Interaction of bimodal fields with few-level atoms in cavities and traps.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09500340308234530)
  - This is a nice review to introduce kinds of generalization of JCM and what characterizes it should be pay attentionto.
  - Also the way how to study / sovle these model. Not in details but in brief.
